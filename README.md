<h1 align=center><code>Balancer CoW AMM</code></h1>

**Balancer CoW AMM** is an automated **portfolio manager**, **liquidity provider**, and **price sensor**, that allows swaps to be executed via the CoW Protocol.

Balancer is based on an N-dimensional invariant surface which is a generalization of the constant product formula described by Vitalik Buterin and proven viable by the popular Uniswap dapp.

## Development

Most users will want to consume the ABI definitions for BPool, BCoWPool, BFactory and BCoWFactory.

This project follows the standard Foundry project structure. 

```
yarn build   # build artifacts to `out/`
yarn test    # run the tests
```

## Changes on BPool from [Balancer V1](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-core)
- Migrated to Foundry project structure
- Implementation of interfaces with Natspec documentation
- Replaced `require(cond, 'STRING')` for `if(!cond) revert CustomError()`
- Bumped Solidity version from `0.5.12` to `0.8.25` (required for transient storage)
  - Added explicit `unchecked` blocks to `BNum` operations (to avoid Solidity overflow checks)
- Deprecated `Record.balance` storage (in favour of `ERC20.balanceOf(address(this))`)
- Deprecated `gulp` method (not needed since reading ERC20 balances)
- Deprecated manageable pools:
  - Deprecated `isPublicSwap` mechanism (for pools to be swapped before being finalized)
  - Deprecated `rebind` method (in favour of `bind + unbind + bind`)
  - Deprecated exit fee on `unbind` (since the pool is not supposed to have collected any fees)
- Deprecated `BBaseToken` (in favour of OpenZeppelin `ERC20` implementation)
- Deprecated `BColor` and `BBronze` (unused contracts)
- Deprecated `Migrations` contract (not needed)
- Added an `_afterFinalize` hook (to be called at the end of the finalize routine)
- Implemented reentrancy locks using transient storage.

## Features on BCoWPool (added via inheritance to BPool)
- Immutably stores CoW Protocol's `SolutionSettler` and `VaultRelayer` addresses at deployment
- Immutably stores Cow Protocol's a Domain Separator at deployment (to avoid replay attacks)
- Immutably stores Cow Protocol's `GPv2Order.appData` to be allowed to swap
- Gives infinite ERC20 approval to the CoW Protocol's `VaultRelayer` contract
- Implements IERC1271 `isValidSignature` method to allow for validating intentions of swaps
- Implements a `commit` method to avoid multiple swaps from conflicting with each other.
  - This is stored in the same transient storage slot as reentrancy locks in order to prevent calls to swap/join functions within a settlement execution or vice versa.
  - It's an error to override a commitment since that could be used to clear reentrancy locks. Commitments can only be cleared by ending a transaction.
- Validates the `GPv2Order` requirements before allowing the swap

## Features on BCoWFactory
- Added a `logBCoWPool` to log the finalization of BCoWPool contracts, to be called by a child pool

## Creating a Pool
- Create a new pool by calling `IBFactory.newBPool()`
- Give ERC20 allowance to the pool by calling `IERC20.approve(pool, amount)`
- Bind tokens one by one by calling `IBPool.bind(token, amount, weight)`
  - The amount represents the initial balance of the token in the pool (pulled from the caller's balance)
  - The weight represents the intended distribution of value between the tokens in the pool
- Modify the pool's swap fee by calling `IBPool.setSwapFee(fee)`
- Finalize the pool by calling `IBPool.finalize()`
